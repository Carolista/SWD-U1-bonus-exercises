                <h3>They Don't Need Miracles — They Need Us!</h3>
                <p>
                    Every day, pets in our community are abandoned to hunger, cold nights, and the dangers of the street. They don't ask for much—just safety, warmth, and a chance to belong. Yet too many are left without even that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This crisis is bigger than any one of us—but it's not bigger than all of us together. With your gift, you turn fear into comfort, loneliness into love, and survival into thriving. Every dollar is food, medicine, and a safe place to land for a pet who has nowhere else to go.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please help us continue this vital service—because no pet should spend their life homeless.
                </p>
