					At Main Street Pet Rescue, our commitment to every pet lasts a
					lifetime—even beyond adoption. We understand that sometimes things
					don't work out, and that's okay. If you encounter challenges, let us
					know, and we'll do our best to help. If rehoming becomes necessary, we
					ask that you return the pet to us so we can ensure their continued
					care and well-being. Adoption is just the beginning of your new
					journey— and we're here to support you and your pet every step of the
					way.
				</p>

				<p>
					<em>
						*It costs us around $350 to provide each pet with the essential vet
						care and preparation they need for a happy, healthy start in their
						new home. If you'd like to pay it forward—by covering the full cost
						of your pet's care or with helping another pet find a home—any extra
						donation is truly appreciated!

				<h3>Our Adoption Process: What to Expect</h3>
				<p>
					We want your adoption experience to be welcoming and comfortable, and
					all about finding the right fit—for you and our pets! Here's how it
					works:
				</p>

				<h4>Start with a Warm Welcome & Adoption Application</h4>
				<p>
					When you arrive at Main Street Pet Rescue, our friendly staff or
					volunteers will greet you and help you get started. You'll fill out a
					short Adoption Inquiry Form, which helps us understand what you're
					looking for so we can guide you to the best match.
				</p>

				<h4>Meet the Pets</h4>
				<p>
					Once you're ready, it's time to meet the pets! Whether you stop by
					during open hours or schedule an appointment, our team will introduce
					you to our wonderful furry friends and answer any questions you may
					have. Take your time getting to know them—observe their personalities,
					ask about their quirks, and see who tugs at your heart. Click here to
					schedule an appointment.
				</p>

				<h4>Make It Official</h4>
				<p>
					When you find "the one," we'll walk you through the next steps,
					ensuring you have everything you need for a smooth transition. After
					finalizing the adoption, all that's left is to bring your new
					companion home! Be sure to have a secure carrier (or purchase one from
					us) for a safe and comfortable journey.
				</p>

				<h4>Need More Time Before Pickup?</h4>
				<p>We offer post-adoption holds for up to three weeks:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>First week: Free to give you time to prepare.</li>
					<li>Additional weeks: $25 per week, up to a total of three weeks.</li>
					<li>
						Special circumstances? Let us know—we may be able to hold your pet
						longer!
					</li>
				</ul>
